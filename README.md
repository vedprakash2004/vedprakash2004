🤖 Agentic Personal AI Assistant (n8n + OpenAI)

An advanced multi-agent personal AI assistant built using n8n that integrates OpenAI, Gmail, Google Sheets, Google Calendar, and Telegram.

This system is designed using a modular agent architecture where a main AI assistant intelligently routes user requests to specialized sub-agents for email handling and calendar management.

🧠 System Architecture

The system follows a multi-agent orchestration model:

1. Main Assistant
   - Receives user input from Telegram (text or voice)
   - Uses OpenAI for reasoning and intent classification
   - Routes tasks to appropriate sub-agents

2. Email Agent
   - Handles email-related actions
   - Integrates with Gmail API
   - Fetches contact details from Google Sheets before sending

3. Calendar Agent
   - Handles event scheduling and retrieval
   - Integrates with Google Calendar API
   - Automatically assumes 60-minute duration if not specified

⚙️ How It Works

1. User sends a message via Telegram.
2. The Main Assistant processes the input.
3. The system verifies contact information (if required).
4. The appropriate sub-agent executes the task:
   - Email Agent → Gmail actions
   - Calendar Agent → Event scheduling
5. Response is returned to the user.
